ok please do following action:
we using: 
- loki and Promtail
- Metrics → Prometheus
- Traces → Fiber (OTel SDK) → Tempo or Jaeger
- Dashboards → Grafana
- Alerts → Alertmanager

- create simple API using go + fiber:
    - this api have a demo hit external API with random response (401, 500, timeout, etc)
    - this api would have /health endpoint
    - create a simple middleware for logging:
    - expose a metrics
    - and also for tracing
- create a docker compose for all our service
    - loki
    - promtail
    - prometheus
    - grafana
    - alertmanager
    - tempo or jaeger
    - our api
- please generate a dashboard grafana yaml for our api
    - this dashboard would have:
        - request per second
        - response time
        - error rate
- please generate a alert grafana yaml for our api
    - this alert would have:
        - if our api response time > 1s for 5m then send alert
        - if our api error rate > 10% for 5m then send alert
        - if our api response time > 5s for 1m then send alert
        - if our api error rate > 50% for 1m then send alert
- this alert is sending to alertmanager
- please generate a prometheus yaml for our api
    - this prometheus yaml would have:
        - scrape our api metrics
        - scrape our api traces
